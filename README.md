# online-word-game

based on a previous project. The plan here is to make a multiplayer game where 2 users take turns to plot letters on a baord to make different words.

looks like this:

🔲  🅱️  🔲  🔲  🔲

🔲  🔲  🅰️  🔲  🔲

🔲  🔲  🔲  🅱️  🔲

🔲  🔲  🔲  🔲  🔲  

🔲  🔲  🔲  🔲  🔲

words can be made:
- vertically and horizontally ↕️ ↔️
- diagonally ↖️ ↗️ ↘️ ↙️ 
- backwards and forwards ⬅️ ➡️

Players can create or join game rooms and take turns placeing a letter on a board.
